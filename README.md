# PPiIT-Project
Project for 3rd Year module Professional Practice in IT

This project is a website similar to stack overflow but tailored for student level questions and answers. The main idea for this project came from my past 3 years studying my course 'Computing in Software Development' and the challenges I faced when having to research specific content like programming languages, concepts etc. This website 'Uni Stack' will hopefully create a sense of community among students and assist them during their studies in a positive way. It will also help them prepare for the real world tech jobs where they won't always know the answer and may need to ask other tech workers for their assistance.
